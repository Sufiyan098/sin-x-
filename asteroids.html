                <h2>VESTA</h2>
                <p>Size: Vesta is one of the largest objects in the asteroid
                    belt, with a diameter of about 525 kilometers.
                    
                    Composition: Vesta is classified as a rocky (V-type)
                    asteroid, composed mainly of basaltic rock, similar to the
                    Earth's crust, indicating volcanic activity in its past.
                    
                    Location: Vesta orbits the Sun in the asteroid belt
                    between Mars and Jupiter, at an average distance of
                    about 2.36 Astronomical Units.
                    
                    Surface Features: Vesta has a diverse surface, including
                    deep craters, high mountains, and vast plains. The most
                    notable feature is the Rheasilvia crater, which is about
                    460 km wide and contains one of the tallest mountains in
                    the solar system.
                    
                    NASA's Dawn Mission: Vesta was visited by NASA’s Dawn
                    spacecraft in 2011–2012, providing detailed images and

                <h2>ANNEFRANK</h2>
                <p>Size: Annefrank has a diameter of approximately 32
                    kilometers, making it a medium-sized asteroid in the
                    asteroid belt.
                    Composition: It is classified as an S-type (stony) asteroid,
                    which means it is composed mainly of silicate minerals
                    and metals like nickel and iron.
                    Location: Annefrank orbits the Sun in the main asteroid
                    belt between Mars and Jupiter, with an average distance
                    of about 2.5 Astronomical Units from the Sun.
                    Shape: Annefrank has an irregular, somewhat elongated
                    shape, typical of many asteroids in the belt.
                    Naming: The asteroid is named after Anne Frank, the
                    Jewish diarist who wrote "The Diary of a Young Girl"
                    while hiding from the Nazis during World War II. The
                    name was chosen to honor her memory.
                    Rotation: The rotational period of Annefrank is
                    approximately 7.2 hours.</p>

                <h2>BRAILLE</h2>
                <p>Size: Braille has a diameter of approximately 7.4
                    kilometers, making it a relatively small asteroid.
                    Composition: It is classified as an S-type (stony) asteroid,
                    which indicates that it is composed mainly of silicate
                    minerals and metals like nickel and iron.
                    Location: Braille orbits the Sun in the main asteroid belt
                    between Mars and Jupiter, at an average distance of
                    about 2.4 Astronomical Units.
                    Shape: Braille has an irregular shape, typical of many
                    small asteroids, and its surface features have been
                    observed to be rough and cratered.
                    Naming: The asteroid is named after Louis Braille, the
                    inventor of the Braille writing system, which allows
                    visually impaired individuals to read and write. The name
                    honors his contributions to accessibility and education.
                    Rotation: The rotational period of Braille is
                    approximately 6.5 hours.</p>

                <h2>CERES</h2>
                <p>Size: Ceres is the largest object in the asteroid belt, with a
                    diameter of about 940 kilometers.
                    Composition: Ceres is classified as a dwarf planet due to
                    its size and spherical shape. It has a mixed composition
                    of rock and ice, with significant amounts of water ice and
                    possibly a subsurface ocean.
                    Location: Ceres orbits the Sun in the main asteroid belt
                    between Mars and Jupiter, at an average distance of
                    about 2.77 Astronomical Units.
                    Surface Features: Ceres has a diverse surface with bright
                    spots, particularly in the Occator Crater, which are
                    thought to be deposits of sodium carbonate. It also has a
                    large, dome-shaped mountain called Ahuna Mons.
                    NASA's Dawn Mission: Ceres was visited by NASA's Dawn
                    spacecraft, which orbited Ceres from 2015 to 2018,
                    providing detailed images and data about its surface and
                    composition.
                    Atmosphere: Ceres has a very thin atmosphere, known as
                    an exosphere, composed of water vapor and other trace
                    gases.</p>
