              <p>Mercury is the smallest planet in our solar system and closest to the Sun. It has a very thin atmosphere, which means it cannot retain heat. As a result, temperatures on Mercury can range from extremely hot to extremely cold. The planet has a rocky surface covered with craters.</p>
